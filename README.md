# TypeStub for sha256
source: https://github.com/beenotung/typestub-sha256

## TL;DL
sha256, the npm package, is not typed, this package is to give type to that.
This repo try to fix it (or workaround with it).

## Example
```typescript
import {sha256} from "typestub-sha256";

const hash = sha256('123');
console.log({hash});
```

or import this package directly.

```javascript
var sha256 = require("typestub-sha256");
```
